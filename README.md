# clone of sqlite

based on [chidb](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chidb/index.html) from university of chicago

[sqlite sourcecode](https://github.com/davideuler/SQLite-2.5.0-for-code-reading)

# db
single file - sequence of pages. Page is our storage unit, being a set of disk blocks. Different kind of pages - tables, indexes etc.

btree page == btree node. Each pointer is just a page ID

page internally is a slotted page - this way we can store variable size data in a page, inserts and sorting is easy. Slotted index grows to the end of the page, Cell data grows to the beginning. Page has a header to point what's inside

Overflow page - linked list of pages to store bigger data

table is set of pages
Row format - each Cell is just a row, sequence of bytes.

mostly inserts and reads are allowed. Updates are allowed, but not optimized and can be inefficient.

## btree

b - balanced
* b+ trees for table data
    *  like Btree in which each node contains only keys (not keyâ€“value pairs), and to which an additional level is added at the bottom with linked leaves
* btrees for indexes

    * order of columns in index matters (The moment it encounters an inequality, the indexing stops right there)
    * functions == full table scan
    * inequality operators matters
    * add relevant columns even from select to index
